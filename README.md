When working with an API there's always so much to remember, such as any special API keys, different URLs for different environments, as well as the shape that each request should take. In Postman Fundamentals, you'll learn how Postman can help simplify working with an API. It allows you to use variables so that the same request works whether it's in the testing or staging environment. You'll also learn how you can created automated API tests so that you ensure your API doesn't break between releases. You'll even see how Postman simplifies writing documentation for your API, so that your users can have an up-to-date explanation of what your API is doing. By the end of this course, you'll know the ins and outs of Postman, and be equipped to maximize your interactions with APIs.
